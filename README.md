Africa Images and Map Portal - Indiana University Libraries

This project was created by Mireille Djenno, Mia Partlow, and Theresa Quill for Indiana University Libraries.

Using QGIS and Mapbox.js, we created an index map for our images, maps, and posters from the African Studies Collection at Indiana University Bloomington. This is a work in progress.
